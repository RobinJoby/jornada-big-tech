Hi Camila,

Thanks again for your time just now,  it was a real pleasure speaking with you. As promised, I have attached a PDF for you, which contains a lot more info about the role & responsibilities as well as lots of information about how to prepare for your Hangout/Phone interview. Those who study carefully tend to do considerably better in their interviews!

**What to expect:**

A ~45 minutes technical [Phone/Hangouts interview](https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/interview/#_) with one of our **Software Engineers**. Please open the tab “Interviews for software engineering and technical roles“ and read carefully through it.

Computer Science fundamentals are prerequisite for all engineering roles at Google, regardless of anyone's seniority.

Of course you’ll need a computer with a stable internet Internet connection for this interview so that you can do some coding with your interviewer. It’s recommended to organize a headset or headphones as I am sure you are faster coding with hands-free :-)

**How to prepare for that?
You might want to start by watching these two videos…**
• [How to Work at Google: Prepare for an Engineering Interview](http://app.k6222f.com/click?ld=nrAmV1Ua%2BCOYZnPPAzKW8zw9JgbBXoH9jvw8Hcm8ztZvVAyjUfveDA%2F4xbHY0%2FseJsmEfAvGkiiuk40O8Fdc%2Fzrrm0K%2FqOvkr)
• [How to work at Google: Example Coding/Engineering Interview](http://app.k6222f.com/click?ld=nrAmV1Ua%2BCOYZnPPAzKW8zw9JgbBXoH9sPEAskLMmh1%2F5mpQemfgCdA4AqCEdqzjIGAsMSVpzm73Wz9StC0KJe%2F4tezhpyG%2F19JxrxnFJHAyvCDVI7hPDiNWjGhXAFCbW)

Google interviews focus very heavily on algorithms and data structures. You'll be expected to know and apply: lists, maps, stacks, priority queues, binary trees, graphs, bags, and sets. You'll need to talk about how they're implemented and why you'd choose one implementation or data structure instead of another. For algorithms you'll want to know greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, recursion, and brute force search. You'll definitely want to be conversant with big­O notation, time­space complexity, and real world performance of all of this. Most importantly you'll need to be able to pick the right data structure and algorithm for a specific problem.Suggestions on reading material include:
• Algorithm / Data Structure Theory books
• Google Style Guides ([C++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), [Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), [Java](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html))
• [Coursera - Algorithms, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
• [Coursera - Algorithms, Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)
• [Udacity - Intro to Algorithms](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-algorithms--cs215)- Moving onto the practice after theory:

When you practice, **do not use an IDE**. You need to be able to write legible, compilable code without help with regards to layout, or spelling of standard library class/method names. I suggest solving similar style algorithmic/ DS problems on a google document or on paper to simulate a real interview.

Several sites that provide similar problems to those typically asked in the interview are:

• Problems from [Cracking the Coding Interview Book](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Cracking_the_Coding_Interview.html?id=anhAXwAACAAJ&hl=en)
• [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
• [Topcoder](https://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=MatchDetails&rd=15712)
• [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/contests)
• [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
• [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/)
• [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)
**What's next?**
Once you've had a chance to go through all of the materials, could you please:

1. Please provide me with:
    ◦ Dates/times that are suitable to arrange the phone interview, 5 options over a 2 week period please
    ◦ Preferred way to call you: Hangouts and best number to call you on as a Back up (do you have a headset/headphones so you can type freely?)
    ◦ Preferred coding language for the 1st interview
    ◦ The name of Googlers you know, worldwide (if applicable)
    ◦ An updated version of your CV
2. You should receive an email with an invitation to apply to the role online, please complete this application - it should only take around 5-10 minutes.
3. Once completed, we'll schedule your technical interview accordingly. One of my colleagues will confirm in the next few business days
4. Study, prepare, practice and then ace your interview! If you have any questions please let me know.

I am looking forward to your reply and wish you all the best for your preparation!
Cheers,
