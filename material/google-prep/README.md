## Data structures

- lists
- maps
- stacks
- priority queues
- binary trees
- graphs
- bags
- sets
- arrays
- linked lists
- queues
- hash-sets
- hash-maps
- hash-tables (to be able to implement one using only arrays)
- dictionary
- trees and binary trees
- heaps.

How they're implemented and why you'd choose one implementation or data structure instead of another.

You should know the data structure inside out, and what algorithms tend to go along with each data structure.

Trees - know tree construction, traversal, and manipulation algorithms. Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees and trie-trees, and at least one type of balanced binary tree

## Algorithms

Types:

- greedy algorithms
- divide and conquer
- dynamic programming
- recursion
- brute force search
- sorting (plus searching and binary search)
- dynamic programming/memoization
- greediness
- algorithms linked to a specific data structure

- big­O notation
- time­space complexity
- real world performance
- the complexity of an algorithm and how you can improve/change it

To be able to pick the right data structure and algorithm for a specific problem

Be ready to discuss complex algorithms like Dijkstra and A*.

It is OK to quickly come up with a brute force solution, but that’s never going to be the answer - always look for an O(n*logn) solution or ideally a linear one

● You need to be able to do back of the envelope calculations!

○ Know your powers of 2 (binary)

○ Be able to express mega/giga/etc. in binary and/or scientific notation

○ Explain and justify your assumptions

○ Don’t be afraid of dealing with huge numbers!

● Know a variety of searching and sorting algorithms (Quicksort, Mergesort, Hash Tables,etc.) - know more than one O(n*logn) sorting algorithm - how they work

● System design questions are a test of your problem solving skills - ask qualifying questions - make sure you explain your thought process - explain and justify your assumptions

**MUST READS:**

You must read **Cracking the Coding Interview** and Steve Yegge blog!

I would also strongly recommend that you read one of the below:

**Effective Java, 2nd Edition**, by Xoogler Joshua Bloch. There is no substitute!

**Effective C++, Volume 1**, and **More Effective C++** by Scott Meyers. You can skip the sections relating to details we don't use in Google C++, such as exceptions.

**Generic Interview Tips:**

The following are a few details that can make an interview go more smoothly:

● Do not assume all numbers are ints. Ask for clarification if necessary.

● Do know how to use some sort of map data structure from the standard library of your language of choice; e.g. java.util.HashMap in Java.

● Do know how to use a good sorting algorithm from the standard library of your preferred language; e.g. Collections.sort() and Arrays.sort() in Java.

● Do know how to copy and resize an array if necessary. (Arrays.copyOfRange in Java).

● Try to avoid mutating arguments in your solution.

● Once you've got a solution, try to walk though the code with some small input. E.g. if you're asked to calculate the nearest integer to a square root of an integer without using floating point numbers, try your solution with 1, with 3, with 4. Talk it out with your interviewer as you do this.

Common follow up questions (once you have a solution):

● What's the performance? (e.g. O(N^2), N lg N, etc.) Can you do better?

● How do you test the solution?

● Is this thread safe? If not, can you make it so?

● How do you distribute the solution for very large data sets?
