# Notes - Cracking the Coding Interview Book

## Introduction

And remember-interviews are hard! In my years of interviewing at Google, I saw some interviewers ask "easy" questions while others ask harder questions. But you know what? Getting the easy questions doesn't make it any easier to get the offer. Receiving an offer is not about solving questions flawlessly (very few candidates do!). Rather, it is about answering questions better than other candidates. So don't stress out when you get a tricky question-everyone else probably thought it was hard too. It's okay to not be flaw­ less.

## The Interview Process

Rather, your interviewer will make an assessment of your performance, usually based on the following:
- Analytical skills: Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was your solution? How long did it take you to arrive at a solution? If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you struc­ ture the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?
- Coding skills: Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style?
- Technical knowledge/ Computer Science fundamentals: Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?
- Experience: Have you made good technical decisions in the past? Have you built interesting, challenging projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
- Culture fit/ Communication skills: Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

### How Questions are Selected

At the vast majority of companies, there are no lists of what interviewers should ask. Rather, each inter­ viewer selects their own questions.

### It's All Relative

Interview questions are much the same way. Your interviewer develops a feel for your performance by comparing you to other people. It's not about the candidates she's interviewing that week. It's about all the candidates that she's ever asked this question to.
For this reason, getting a hard question isn't a bad thing. When it's harder for you, it's harder for everyone. It doesn't make it any less likely that you'll do well.

### Can I re-apply to a company after getting rejected?

Almost always, but you typically have to wait a bit (6 months to a 1 year). Your first bad interview usually won't affect you too much when you re-interview. Lots of people get rejected from Google or Microsoft and later get offers from them.
